# mpiFileUtils
mpiFileUtils provides both a library called [libmfu](src/common/README.md) and a suite of MPI-based tools to manage large datasets, which may vary from large directory trees to large files. High-performance computing users often generate large datasets with parallel applications that run with many processes (millions in some cases). However those users are then stuck with single-process tools like cp and rm to manage their datasets. This suite provides MPI-based tools to handle typical jobs like copy, remove, and compare for such datasets, providing speedups of up to 20-30x.  It also provides a library that simplifies the creation of new tools or can be used in applications.

Documentation is available on [ReadTheDocs](http://mpifileutils.readthedocs.io).

## DAOS Support

mpiFileUtils supports a DAOS backend for dcp, dsync, and dcmp. Details and usage examples are provided in [DAOS Support](DAOS-Support.md).
