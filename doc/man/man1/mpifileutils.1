.SH OVERVIEW
.sp
mpiFileUtils provides both a library called libmfu and a suite of MPI\-based
tools to manage large datasets, which may vary from large directory trees to
large files. High\-performance computing users often generate large datasets with
parallel applications that run with many processes (millions in some cases).
However those users are then stuck with single\-process tools like cp and rm to
manage their datasets. This suite provides MPI\-based tools to handle typical
jobs like copy, remove, and compare for such datasets, providing speedups of up
to 50x. It also provides a library that simplifies the creation of new tools
or can be used in applications
.SH UTILITIES
.sp
The tools in mpiFileUtils are actually MPI applications. They must be launched
as MPI applications, e.g., within a compute allocation on a cluster using
mpirun. The tools do not currently checkpoint, so one must be careful that an
invocation of the tool has sufficient time to complete before it is killed.
Example usage of each tool is provided below.

.SH USER GUIDE
.SS Build
.sp
mpiFileUtils depends on several libraries. mpiFileUtils is available in
\fI\%Spack\fP, which simplifies the install to just:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ spack install mpifileutils
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
or to enable all features:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ spack install mpifileutils +lustre +experimental
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
To build from a release tarball, use CMake. Note that this requires the manual
installation of the dependencies. Assuming the dependencies have been placed in
an \fIinstall\fP directory the build commands are thus:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ git clone https://github.com/hpc/mpifileutils
$ mkdir build install
$ # build DTCMP and other dependencies
$ cd build
$ cmake ../mpifileutils \-DWITH_DTCMP_PREFIX=../install \-DWITH_LibCircle_PREFIX=../install \-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
One can also use spack to create an environment and view with the provided \fIspack.yaml\fP file.
First, make sure that you’ve set up spack in your shell (see \fI\%these instructions\fP).
Next, be sure that your \fI~/.spack/packages.yaml\fP is configured to ensure that spack can detect system\-provided packages.
.sp
From the root directory of mpifileutils, run the command \fIspack find\fP to determine which packages spack will install.
Next, run \fIspack concretize\fP to build have spack perform dependency analysis.
Finally, run \fIspack install\fP to build the dependencies.
.sp
There are two ways to tell CMake about the dependencies.
First, you can use \fIspack load [depname]\fP to put the installed dependency into your environment paths.
Then, at configure time, CMake will automatically detect the location of these dependencies.
Thus, the commands to build become:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
$ git clone https://github.com/hpc/mpifileutils
$ mkdir build install
$ cd mpifileutils
$ spack install
$ spack load dtcmp
$ spack load libcircle
$ spack load libarchive
$ cd ../build
$ cmake ../mpifileutils
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The other way to use spack is to create a “view” to the installed dependencies.
Details on this are coming soon.
.SS Project Design Principles
.sp
The following principles drive design decisions in the project.
.SS Scale
.sp
The library and tools should be designed such that running with more processes
increases performance, provided there are sufficient data and parallelism
available in the underlying file systems. The design of the tool should not
impose performance scalability bottlenecks.
.SS Performance
.sp
While it is tempting to mimic the interface, behavior, and file formats of
familiar tools like cp, rm, and tar, when forced with a choice between
compatibility and performance, mpiFileUtils chooses performance. For example,
if an archive file format requires serialization that inhibits parallel
performance, mpiFileUtils will opt to define a new file format that enables
parallelism rather than being constrained to existing formats. Similarly,
options in the tool command line interface may have different semantics from
familiar tools in cases where performance is improved. Thus, one should be
careful to learn the options of each tool.
.SS Portability
.sp
The tools are intended to support common file systems used in HPC centers, like
Lustre, GPFS, and NFS. Additionally, methods in the library should be portable
and efficient across multiple file systems. Tool and library users can rely on
mpiFileUtils to provide portable and performant implementations.
.SS Composability
.sp
While the tools do not support chaining with Unix pipes, they do support
interoperability through input and output files. One tool may process a dataset
and generate an output file that another tool can read as input, e.g., to walk
a directory tree with one tool, filter the list of file names with another, and
perhaps delete a subset of matching files with a third. Additionally, when logic
is deemed to be useful across multiple tools or is anticipated to be useful in
future tools or applications, it should be provided in the common library.
.SS libmfu
.sp
Functionality that is common to multiple tools is moved to the common library,
libmfu. This goal of this library is to make it easy to develop new tools and
to provide consistent behavior across tools in the suite. The library can also
be useful to end applications, e.g., to efficiently create or remove a large
directory tree in a portable way across different parallel file systems.
.SS libmfu: the mpiFileUtils common library
.sp
The mpiFileUtils common library defines data structures and methods on those
data structures that makes it easier to develop new tools or for use within HPC
applications to provide portable, performant implementations across file
systems common in HPC centers.
.INDENT 0.0

.sp
.nf
.ft C
#include "mfu.h"
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
This file includes all other necessary headers.
.SS mfu_flist
.sp
The key data structure in libmfu is a distributed file list called mfu_flist.
This structure represents a list of files, each with stat\-like metadata, that
is distributed among a set of MPI ranks.
.sp
The library contains functions for creating and operating on these lists. For
example, one may create a list by recursively walking an existing directory or
by inserting new entries one at a time. Given a list as input, functions exist
to create corresponding entries (inodes) on the file system or to delete the
list of files. One may filter, sort, and remap entries. One can copy a list of
entries from one location to another or compare corresponding entries across
two different lists. A file list can be serialized and written to or read from
a file.
.sp
Each MPI rank “owns” a portion of the list, and there are routines to step
through the entries owned by that process. This portion is referred to as the
“local” list. Functions exist to get and set properties of the items in the
local list, for example to get the path name, type, and size of a file.
Functions dealing with the local list can be called by the MPI process
independently of other MPI processes.
.sp
Other functions operate on the global list in a collective fashion, such as
deleting all items in a file list. All processes in the MPI job must invoke
these functions simultaenously.
.sp
For full details, see \fI\%mfu_flist.h\fP
and refer to its usage in existing tools.
.SS mfu_path
.sp
mpiFileUtils represents file paths with the \fI\%mfu_path\fP
structure. Functions are available to manipulate paths to prepend and append
entries, to slice paths into pieces, and to compute relative paths.
.SS mfu_param_path
.sp
Path names provided by the user on the command line (parameters) are handled
through the \fImfu_param_path <https://github.com/hpc/mpifileutils/blob/master/src/common/mfu_param_path.h>_\fP
structure. Such paths may have to be checked for existence and to determine
their type (file or directory). Additionally, the user may specify many such
paths through invocations involving shell wildcards, so functions are available
to check long lists of paths in parallel.
.SS mfu_io_and_mfu_util
.sp
The \fI\%mfu_io.h\fP
functions provide wrappers for many POSIX\-IO functions. This is helpful for
checking error codes in a consistent manner and automating retries on failed
I/O calls. One should use the wrappers in mfu_io if available, and if not, one
should consider adding the missing wrapper.
.sp
The \fI\%mfu_util.h\fP
functions provide wrappers for error reporting and memory allocation.
.SH MAN PAGES
.SS dbcast
.SS SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdbcast [OPTION] SRC DEST\fP
.SS DESCRIPTION
.sp
Parallel MPI application to recursively broadcast a single file from a
global file system to node\-local storage, like ramdisk or an SSD.
.sp
The file is logically sliced into chunks and collectively copied from a
global file system to node\-local storage. The source file SRC must be
readable by all MPI processes. The destination file DEST should be the
full path of the file in node\-local storage. If needed, parent
directories for the destination file will be created as part of the
broadcast.
.sp
In the current implementation, dbcast requires at least two MPI
processes per compute node, and all compute nodes must run an equal
number of MPI processes.
.SS OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-size SIZE

T}
_
T{
EXIST=COMMON
T}	T{
entry exists in both source and destination
T}
_
.TE
.sp
All other fields may only specify the DIFFER and COMMON states.
.sp
Conditions can be joined together with AND (@) and OR (,) operators without spaces to build complex expressions.
For example, the following expression reports entries that exist in both source and destination paths, but are of different types:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
EXIST=COMMON@TYPE=DIFFER
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The AND operator binds with higher precedence than the OR operator.
For example, the following expression matches on entries which either (exist in both soure and destination and whose types differ) or (only exist in the source):
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
EXIST=COMMON@TYPE=DIFFER,EXIST=SRC_ONLY
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Some conditions imply others.
For example, for CONTENT to be considered the same,
the entry must exist in both source and destination, the types must match, the sizes must match, and finally the contents must match:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
SIZE=COMMON    => EXISTS=COMMON@TYPE=COMMON@SIZE=COMMON
CONTENT=COMMON => EXISTS=COMMON@TYPE=COMMON@SIZE=COMMON@CONTENT=COMMON
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
A successful check on any other field also implies that EXIST=COMMON.
.sp
When used with the \-o option, one must also specify a file name at the end of the expression, separated with a ‘:’.
The list of any entries that match the expression are written to the named file.
For example, to list any entries matching the above expression to a file named outfile1,
one should use the following option:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
\-o EXIST=COMMON@TYPE=DIFFER:outfile1
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
If the –base option is given or when no output option is specified,
the following expressions are checked and numeric results are reported to stdout:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
EXIST=COMMON
EXIST=DIFFER
EXIST=COMMON@TYPE=COMMON
EXIST=COMMON@TYPE=DIFFER

.SS DESCRIPTION
.sp
Parallel MPI application to report files under a directory tree having identical content.
.sp
ddup reports path names to files having identical content (duplicate files).
A top\-level directory is specified, and the path name to any file that is a duplicate
of another anywhere under that same directory tree is reported.
The path to each file is reported, along with a final hash representing its content.
Multiple sets of duplicate files can be matched using this final reported hash.
