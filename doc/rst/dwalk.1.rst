dwalk
=====

SYNOPSIS
--------

Parallel MPI application to recursively walk and list contents in a
directory.

dwalk provides functionality similar to :manpage:`ls(1)` and :manpage:`du(1)`. Like
:manpage:`du(1)`, the tool reports a summary of the total number of files and
bytes. Like :manpage:`ls(1)`, the tool sorts and prints information about
individual files.

The output can be sorted on different fields (e.g, name, user, group,
size, etc). A histogram of file sizes can be computed listing the number
of files that fall into user-defined bins.

OPTIONS
-------

.. option:: -i, --input FILE

   Read source list from FILE. FILE must be generated by another tool
   from the mpiFileUtils suite.

.. option:: -o, --output FILE

   Write the processed list to a file.

.. option:: -l, --lite

   Walk file system without stat.

.. option:: -s, --sort FIELD

   Sort output by comma-delimited fields (see below).

.. option:: -d, --distribution size:SEPARATORS

   Print the distribution of file sizes. For example, specifying
   size:0,80,100 will report the number of files that have size 0
   bytes, between 1-80 bytes, between 81-99 bytes, and 100 bytes or
   greater.

.. option:: -p, --print

   Print files to the screen.

.. option:: -v, --verbose

   Run in verbose mode.

.. option:: -h, --help

   Print usage.

SORT FIELDS
-----------

By default, the list of files dwalk captures is not sorted. To sort the
list, one or more fields can be specified in a comma-delimited list:

name,user,group,uid,gid,atime,mtime,ctime,size

A field name can be preceded with ‘-’ to sort by that field in reverse
order.

A lexicographic sort is executed if more than one field is given.

EXAMPLES
--------

1. To print summary information for a directory:

``mpirun -np 128 dwalk -v /dir/to/walk``

2. To print a list of files, sorted by file size, then by file name:

``mpirun -np 128 dwalk –print –sort size,name /dir/to/walk``

3. To save the list of files:

``mpirun -np 128 dwalk –output out.dwalk /dir/to/walk``

4. Print the file distribution for specified histogram based on the size
   field from the top level directory.

``mpirun -np 128 dwalk -v –print -d size:0,20,1G src/``
