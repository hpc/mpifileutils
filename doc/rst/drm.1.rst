SYNOPSIS
--------

**drm [OPTION] PATH...**

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Parallel MPI application to recursively delete a directory and its
contents.

drm is a tool for removing files recursively in parallel.
drm behaves like `rm -rf`, but it is faster.

.. note::

    DO NOT USE SHELL REGEX!!!
    The --match and --exclude options use POSIX regex syntax. Because of
    this make sure that the shell does not try to interpret your regex before
    it gets passed to the program. You can generally use quotes around your
    regex to prevent the shell from expanding. An example of this using the
    --match option with --dryrun would be:

    ``mpirun -np 128 drm --dryrun -v --name --match 'file_.*' /path/to/dir/*``

OPTIONS
-------

.. option:: -i, --input FILE

   Read source list from FILE. FILE must be generated by another tool
   from the mpiFileUtils suite.

.. option:: -l, --lite

   Walk file system without stat.

.. option:: --exclude REGEX

   Do not remove items whose full path matches REGEX, processed by :manpage:`regexec(3)`.

.. option:: --match REGEX

   Only remove items whose full path matches REGEX, processed by
   :manpage:`regexec(3)`.

.. option:: --name

   Change --exclude and match to apply to item name rather than its
   full path.

.. option:: --dryrun

   Print a list of files that **would** be deleted without deleting
   them. This is useful to check list of items satisfying --exclude or
   --match options before actually deleting anything.

.. option:: --aggressive

   This option will delete files during the walk phase, and then
   delete directories by level after the walk in drm. You cannot
   use this option with --dryrun.

.. option:: -T, --traceless

   Delete child items without updating the mtime on their parent directory.

.. option:: -v, --verbose

   Run in verbose mode.

.. option:: -h, --help

   Print a brief message listing the :manpage:`drm(1)` options and usage.

EXAMPLES
--------

1. To delete a directory and its contents:

``mpirun -np 128 drm -v /dir/to/delete``

2. Delete all items (files and directories) ending with .core from
   directory tree:

``mpirun -np 128 drm --match '.core$' /dir/to/delete/from``

3. List items that would be deleted without removing them:

``mpirun -np 128 drm --dryrun --match '.core$' /dir/to/delete/from``

4. Delete all items named foo:

``mpirun -np 128 drm --name --match '^foo$' /dir/to/delete/from``
