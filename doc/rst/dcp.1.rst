dcp
===

SYNOPSIS
--------

**dcp [OPTION] SRC DEST**

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Parallel MPI application to recursively copy files and directories.

dcp is a file copy tool in the spirit of :manpage:`cp(1)` that evenly distributes
work across a large cluster without any centralized state. It is
designed for copying files that are located on a distributed parallel
file system.

OPTIONS
-------

.. option:: -i, --input FILE

   Read source list from FILE. FILE must be generated by another tool
   from the mpiFileUtils suite.

.. option:: -p, --preserve

   Preserve permissions, group, timestamps, and extended attributes.

.. option:: -s, --synchronous

   Use synchronous read/write calls (open files with 0_DIRECT)

.. option:: -S, --sparse

   Create sparse files when possible (non-functioning).

.. option:: -v, --verbose

   Run in verbose mode.

.. option:: -q, --quiet

   Run tool silently. No output is printed.

.. option:: -h, --help

   Print a brief message listing the :manpage:`dcp(1)` options and usage.

RESTRICTIONS
------------

If a long-running copy is interrupted, one should delete the partial
copy and run dcp again from the beginning. One may use drm to quickly
remove a partial copy of a large directory tree.

To ensure the copy is successful, one should run dcmp after dcp
completes to verify the copy, especially if dcp was not run with the -s
option.

EXAMPLES
--------

1. To copy dir1 as dir2:

``mpirun -np 128 dcp /source/dir1 /dest/dir2``

2. To copy contents of dir1 into dir2:

``mkdir /dest/dir2 mpirun -np 128 dcp /source/dir1/\* /dest/dir2``

3. To copy while preserving permissions, group, timestamps, and
   attributes:

``mpirun -np 128 dcp -p /source/dir1/ /dest/dir2``

KNOWN BUGS
----------

Using the -S option for sparse files does not work yet at LLNL. If you
try to use it then dcp will default to a normal copy.

The maximum supported file name length for any file transferred is
approximately 4068 characters. This may be less than the number of
characters that your operating system supports.
