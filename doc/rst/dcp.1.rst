SYNOPSIS
--------

**dcp [OPTION] SRC DEST**

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Parallel MPI application to recursively copy files and directories.

dcp is a file copy tool in the spirit of :manpage:`cp(1)` that evenly
distributes the work of scanning the directory tree, and copying file
data across a large cluster without any centralized state.  It is
designed for copying files that are located on a distributed parallel
file system, and it splits large file copies across multiple processes.

OPTIONS
-------
.. option:: -b, --blocksize SIZE

   Set the I/O buffer to be SIZE bytes.  Units like "MB" and "GB" may
   immediately follow the number without spaces (eg. 8MB). The default
   blocksize is 1MB.

.. option:: --daos-src-pool POOL

   Specify the DAOS source pool to be used.

.. option:: --daos-dst-pool POOL

   Specify the DAOS destination pool to be used.

.. option:: --daos-src-cont CONTAINER

   Specify the DAOS source container to be used.

.. option:: --daos-dst-cont CONTAINER

   Specify the DAOS destination container to be used.

.. option:: --daos-svcl SVC

   Specify the DAOS replication level to be used.

.. option:: --daos-prefix PREFIX

   Specify the DAOS prefix to be used. This is only necessary
   if copying a subset of a POSIX container in DAOS using a
   Unified Namespace path.

.. option:: -i, --input FILE

   Read source list from FILE. FILE must be generated by another tool
   from the mpiFileUtils suite.

.. option:: -k, --chunksize SIZE

   Split large files into chunks of SIZE bytes to be processed.  Multiple
   process ranks may copy a large file in parallel.  Units like "MB" and
   "GB" can immediately follow the number without spaces (eg. 64MB).
   The default chunksize is 1MB.

.. option:: -p, --preserve

   Preserve permissions, group, timestamps, and extended attributes.

.. option:: -s, --synchronous

   Use synchronous read/write calls (open files with O_DIRECT).
   This also avoids caching the file data on the client nodes.

.. option:: -S, --sparse

   Create sparse files when possible.

.. option:: --progress N

   Print progress message to stdout approximately every N seconds.
   The number of seconds must be a non-negative integer.
   A value of 0 disables progress messages.

.. option:: -v, --verbose

   Run in verbose mode.

.. option:: -q, --quiet

   Run tool silently. No output is printed.

.. option:: -h, --help

   Print a brief message listing the :manpage:`dcp(1)` options and usage.

RESTRICTIONS
------------

If a long-running copy is interrupted, one should delete the partial
copy and run dcp again from the beginning. One may use drm to quickly
remove a partial copy of a large directory tree.

To ensure the copy is successful, one should run dcmp after dcp
completes to verify the copy, especially if dcp was not run with the -s
option.

EXAMPLES
--------

1. To copy dir1 as dir2:

``mpirun -np 128 dcp /source/dir1 /dest/dir2``

2. To copy contents of dir1 into dir2:

``mkdir /dest/dir2 mpirun -np 128 dcp /source/dir1/\* /dest/dir2``

3. To copy while preserving permissions, group, timestamps, and
   attributes:

``mpirun -np 128 dcp -p /source/dir1/ /dest/dir2``

KNOWN BUGS
----------

Using the -S option for sparse files does not work yet at LLNL. If you
try to use it then dcp will default to a normal copy.

The maximum supported file name length for any file transferred is
approximately 4068 characters. This may be less than the number of
characters that your operating system supports.
