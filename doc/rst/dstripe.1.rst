SYNOPSIS
--------

**dstripe [OPTION] PATH...**

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Parallel MPI application to restripe files.

This tool is in active development. It currently only works on Lustre.

dstripe enables one to restripe file(s) across the underlying storage
devices. One must specify a list of paths. All files in those paths can
be restriped. By default, stripe size is 1MB and stripe count is -1
allowing dstripe to use all available stripes.

OPTIONS
-------

.. option:: -c, --count STRIPE_COUNT

   The number of stripes to use during file restriping. If STRIPE_COUNT
   is -1, then all available stripes are used. If STRIPE_COUNT is 0,
   the lustre file system default is used. The default stripe count is
   -1.

.. option:: -s, --size STRIPE_SIZE

   The stripe size to use during file restriping. Units like "MB" and
   "GB" can immediately follow the number without spaces (ex. 2MB). The
   default stripe size is 1MB.

.. option:: -m, --minsize SIZE

   The minimum size a file must be to be a candidate for restriping.
   Files smaller than SIZE will not be restriped. Units like "MB" and
   "GB" can immediately follow the number without spaces (ex. 2MB). The
   default minimum file size is 0MB.

.. option:: -r, --report

   Display the file size, stripe count, and stripe size of all files
   found in PATH. No restriping is performed when using this option.

.. option:: --progress N

   Print progress message to stdout approximately every N seconds.
   The number of seconds must be a non-negative integer.
   A value of 0 disables progress messages.

.. option:: -v, --verbose

   Run in verbose mode.

.. option:: -q, --quiet

   Run tool silently. No output is printed.

.. option:: -h, --help

   Print the command usage, and the list of options available.

EXAMPLES
--------

1. To stripe a file on all storage devices using a 1MB stripe size:

``mpirun -np 128 dstripe -s 1MB /path/to/file``

2. To stripe a file across 20 storage devices with a 1GB stripe size:

``mpirun -np 128 dstripe -c 20 -s 1GB /path/to/file``

3. To restripe all files in /path/to/files/ that are at least 1GB in
   size:

``mpirun -np 128 dstripe -m 1GB /path/to/files/``

4. To restripe all files in /path/to/files/ across 10 storage devices
   with 2MB stripe size:

``mpirun -np 128 dstripe -c 10 -s 2MB /path/to/files/``

5. To display the current stripe count and stripe size of all files in
   /path/to/files/:

``mpirun -np 128 dstripe -r /path/to/files/``
