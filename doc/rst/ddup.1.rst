DESCRIPTION

Parallel MPI application to report files under a directory tree having identical content.

ddup reports path names to files having identical content (duplicate files).
A top-level directory is specified, and the path name to any file that is a duplicate

The path to each file is reported, along with a final hash representing its content.
Multiple sets of duplicate files can be matched using this final reported hash.
