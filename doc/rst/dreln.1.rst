dreln
=====

SYNOPSIS
--------

**dreln [OPTION] OLDPATH NEWPATH PATH ...**

DESCRIPTION
-----------

Parallel MPI application to recursively update symlinks within a
directory.

dreln walks the specified PATH and updates any symlink whose target
includes an absolute path to OLDPATH and replaces that symlink
with a new link whose target points to NEWPATH instead.

This is useful to update symlinks after migrating a large
directory from one file system to another, whose links specify
absolute paths to the original file system.

OPTIONS
-------

.. option:: -i, --input FILE

   Read source list from FILE. FILE must be generated by another tool
   from the mpiFileUtils suite.

.. option:: -r, --relative

   Replace links using target paths that are relative to NEWPATH.

.. option:: -v, --verbose

   Run in verbose mode.

.. option:: -h, --help

   Print a brief message listing the :manpage:`drm(1)` options and usage.

EXAMPLES
--------

1. To update all links under /walk/path whose targets point to /orig/path
and replace them with targets that point to /new/path:

``mpirun -np 128 dreln -v /orig/path /new/path /walk/path``

2. Same as above, but replace each link target with a relative path
from the link to its new target under /new/path:

``mpirun -np 128 dreln -v --relative /orig/path /new/path /walk/path``

3. One can specifiy multiple paths to walk:

``mpirun -np 128 dreln -v /orig/path /new/path /walk/path1 /walk/path2``
