.SH DBCAST
.SS SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdbcast [OPTION] SRC DEST\fP
.SS DESCRIPTION
.sp
Parallel MPI application to recursively broadcast a single file from a
global file system to node\-local storage, like ramdisk or an SSD.
.sp
The file is logically sliced into chunks and collectively copied from a
global file system to node\-local storage. The source file SRC must be
readable by all MPI processes. The destination file DEST should be the
full path of the file in node\-local storage. If needed, parent
directories for the destination file will be created as part of the
broadcast.
.sp
In the current implementation, dbcast requires at least two MPI
processes per compute node, and all compute nodes must run an equal
number of MPI processes.
.SS OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-size SIZE
The chunk size in bytes used to segment files during the broadcast.
Units like “MB” and “GB” should be immediately follow the number
without spaces (ex. 2MB). The default size is 1MB. It is recommended
to use the stripe size of a file if this is known.

.sp
Parallel MPI application to recursively change permissions and/or group
from a top level directory.
.sp
dchmod provides functionality similar to \fBchmod(1)\fP, \fBchown(1)\fP, and \fBchgrp(1)\fP\&.
Like \fBchmod(1)\fP, the tool supports the use of octal or symbolic mode to
change the permissions.

mode bits are combined with umask to determine the actual mode.

T}
_
.TE
.sp
All other fields may only specify the DIFFER and COMMON states.
.sp
Conditions can be joined together with AND (@) and OR (,) operators without spaces to build complex expressions.
For example, the following expression reports entries that exist in both source and destination paths, but are of different types:
.INDENT 0.0

When used with the \-o option, one must also specify a file name at the end of the expression, separated with a ‘:’.
The list of any files that match the expression are written to the named file.
For example, to list any entries matching the above expression to a file named outfile1,
one should use the following option:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\-o \fI\%EXIST=COMMON@TYPE=DIFFER\fP:outfile1

.SS DESCRIPTION
.sp
Parallel MPI application to recursively copy files and directories.

dcp is a file copy tool in the spirit of \fBcp(1)\fP that evenly distributes
work across a large cluster without any centralized state. It is
designed for copying files that are located on a distributed parallel
file system.

.SS RESTRICTIONS
.sp
If a long\-running copy is interrupted, one should delete the partial
copy and run dcp again from the beginning. One may use drm to quickly
remove a partial copy of a large directory tree.
.sp
To ensure the copy is successful, one should run dcmp after dcp
completes to verify the copy, especially if dcp was not run with the \-s
option.
.SS EXAMPLES
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
To copy dir1 as dir2:
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBmpirun \-np 128 dcp /source/dir1 /dest/dir2\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 2. 3
To copy contents of dir1 into dir2:
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBmkdir /dest/dir2 mpirun \-np 128 dcp /source/dir1/\e* /dest/dir2\fP
.INDENT 0.0

To copy while preserving permissions, group, timestamps, and
attributes:
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBmpirun \-np 128 dcp \-p /source/dir1/ /dest/dir2\fP
.SS KNOWN BUGS
.sp
Using the \-S option for sparse files does not work yet at LLNL. If you
try to use it then dcp will default to a normal copy.
.sp
The maximum supported file name length for any file transferred is
approximately 4068 characters. This may be less than the number of
characters that your operating system supports.

By default, the list of files dwalk captures is not sorted. To sort the
list, one or more fields can be specified in a comma\-delimited list:
.sp

.sp
A field name can be preceded with ‘\-’ to sort by that field in reverse
order.
.sp
A lexicographic sort is executed if more than one field is given.
