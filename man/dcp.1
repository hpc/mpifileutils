.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdcp [OPTION] SRC DEST\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Parallel MPI application to recursively copy files and directories.
.sp
dcp is a file copy tool in the spirit of \fBcp(1)\fP that evenly
distributes the work of scanning the directory tree, and copying file
data across a large cluster without any centralized state.  It is
designed for copying files that are located on a distributed parallel
file system, and it splits large file copies across multiple processes.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-blocksize SIZE
Set the I/O buffer to be SIZE bytes.  Units like “MB” and “GB” may
immediately follow the number without spaces (eg. 8MB). The default
blocksize is 1MB.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-input FILE
Read source list from FILE. FILE must be generated by another tool
from the mpiFileUtils suite.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-k, \-\-chunksize SIZE
Split large files into chunks of SIZE bytes to be processed.  Multiple
process ranks may copy a large file in parallel.  Units like “MB” and
“GB” can immediately follow the number without spaces (eg. 64MB).
The default chunksize is 1MB.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-preserve
Preserve permissions, group, timestamps, and extended attributes.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-synchronous
Use synchronous read/write calls (open files with O_DIRECT).
This also avoids caching the file data on the client nodes.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-S, \-\-sparse
Create sparse files when possible.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-progress N
Print progress message to stdout approximately every N seconds.
The number of seconds must be a non\-negative integer.
A value of 0 disables progress messages.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Run in verbose mode.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Run tool silently. No output is printed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a brief message listing the \fBdcp(1)\fP options and usage.
.UNINDENT
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.sp
If a long\-running copy is interrupted, one should delete the partial
copy and run dcp again from the beginning. One may use drm to quickly
remove a partial copy of a large directory tree.
.sp
To ensure the copy is successful, one should run dcmp after dcp
completes to verify the copy, especially if dcp was not run with the \-s
option.
.SH EXAMPLES
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
To copy dir1 as dir2:
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBmpirun \-np 128 dcp /source/dir1 /dest/dir2\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 2. 3
To copy contents of dir1 into dir2:
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBmkdir /dest/dir2 mpirun \-np 128 dcp /source/dir1/\e* /dest/dir2\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 3. 3
To copy while preserving permissions, group, timestamps, and
attributes:
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBmpirun \-np 128 dcp \-p /source/dir1/ /dest/dir2\fP
.SH KNOWN BUGS
.sp
Using the \-S option for sparse files does not work yet at LLNL. If you
try to use it then dcp will default to a normal copy.
.sp
The maximum supported file name length for any file transferred is
approximately 4068 characters. This may be less than the number of
characters that your operating system supports.
