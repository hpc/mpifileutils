.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdcp [OPTION] SRC DEST\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Parallel MPI application to recursively copy files and directories.
.sp
dcp is a file copy tool in the spirit of \fBcp(1)\fP that evenly
distributes the work of scanning the directory tree, and copying file
data across a large cluster without any centralized state.  It is
designed for copying files that are located on a distributed parallel
file system, and it splits large file copies across multiple processes.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-bufsize SIZE
Set the I/O buffer to be SIZE bytes.  Units like “MB” and “GB” may
immediately follow the number without spaces (eg. 8MB). The default
bufsize is 64MB.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-chunksize SIZE
Multiple processes copy a large file in parallel by dividing it into chunks.
Set chunk to be at minimum SIZE bytes.  Units like “MB” and
“GB” can immediately follow the number without spaces (eg. 64MB).
The default chunksize is 64MB.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-daos\-prefix PREFIX
Specify the DAOS prefix to be used. This is only necessary
if copying a subset of a POSIX container in DAOS using a
Unified Namespace path.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-daos\-api API
Specify the DAOS API to be used. By default, the API is automatically
determined based on the container type, where POSIX containers use the
DFS API, and all other containers use the DAOS object API.
Values must be in {DFS, DAOS}.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-input FILE
Read source list from FILE. FILE must be generated by another tool
from the mpiFileUtils suite.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-L, \-\-dereference
Dereference symbolic links and copy the target file or directory
that each symbolic link refers to.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-P, \-\-no\-dereference
Do not follow symbolic links in source paths. Effectviely allows
symbolic links to be copied when the link target is not valid
or there is not permission to read the link’s target.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-preserve
Preserve permissions, group, timestamps, and extended attributes.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-s, \-\-direct
Use O_DIRECT to avoid caching file data.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-S, \-\-sparse
Create sparse files when possible.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-progress N
Print progress message to stdout approximately every N seconds.
The number of seconds must be a non\-negative integer.
A value of 0 disables progress messages.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-verbose
Run in verbose mode.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-q, \-\-quiet
Run tool silently. No output is printed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Print a brief message listing the \fBdcp(1)\fP options and usage.
.UNINDENT
.SH RESTRICTIONS
.sp
If a long\-running copy is interrupted, one should delete the partial
copy and run dcp again from the beginning. One may use drm to quickly
remove a partial copy of a large directory tree.
.sp
To ensure the copy is successful, one should run dcmp after dcp
completes to verify the copy, especially if dcp was not run with the \-s
option.
.SH EXAMPLES
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
To copy dir1 as dir2:
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBmpirun \-np 128 dcp /source/dir1 /dest/dir2\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 2. 3
To copy contents of dir1 into dir2:
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBmkdir /dest/dir2 mpirun \-np 128 dcp /source/dir1/\e* /dest/dir2\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 3. 3
To copy while preserving permissions, group, timestamps, and
attributes:
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBmpirun \-np 128 dcp \-p /source/dir1/ /dest/dir2\fP
.SH KNOWN BUGS
.sp
Using the \-S option for sparse files does not work yet at LLNL. If you
try to use it then dcp will default to a normal copy.
.sp
The maximum supported file name length for any file transferred is
approximately 4068 characters. This may be less than the number of
characters that your operating system supports.
